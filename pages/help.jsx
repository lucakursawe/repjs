          <strong className="text-primary-orange">Rating Perceived Exertion (RPE)</strong> is a numerical scale used to measure the intensity of exercise based on how hard you feel youâ€™re working. Originally developed by Gunnar Borg for endurance training, it has been adapted for resistance training to better gauge effort during sets.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use RPE?</h2> {/* Subheader for the question "Why Use RPE?" */}
        <p className="mb-4">
          RPE helps lifters manage their training load and intensity more effectively. It allows for adjustments based on daily fluctuations in strength and energy levels, ensuring that you train at the appropriate intensity.

        <p className="mb-4">
          To use RPE effectively, start by estimating your RPE after each set. Over time, you will become more accurate in gauging your effort. This helps in selecting the appropriate load for each set, ensuring you train effectively without overreaching or undertraining.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Beginners should initially use RPE to record their perceived effort after each set. With experience, you can start using RPE to guide your training loads. It is important to stay conservative with your estimates to avoid training to failure too often, which can lead to excessive fatigue and hinder progress.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Advanced Use of RPE</h2> {/* Subheader for the question "Advanced Use of RPE" */}
        <p className="mb-4">
          Experienced lifters can use RPE to fine-tune their training programs. By adjusting loads based on daily performance, lifters can maximize their training efficiency and progress. RPE can also be used in conjunction with percentage-based training to provide a more comprehensive approach.
